  abstract  = {A recent development is the application of AI to either alter or create video and audio files - called Deepfakes. The paper examines the issues arising from deepfakes, to determine how robust the UK justice system is against deepfakes. The work analyses deepfake technology, with respect to an evaluation of professional knowledge, evidential standards, and current legislation. The paper discusses difficulties presented by deepfakes, highlighting the need for methods to authenticate digital evidence, and considers what UK legal remedies can protect the justice system and public from digitally falsified evidence. The paper concludes with potential recommendations for the justice system.},
